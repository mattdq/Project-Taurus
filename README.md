# Project-Taurus

This is the first part of a bigger project I'm building, the project FRUVIS that stands for (Forma Realista Unificada de Vida inteligente e Sistemica) (Unified Realistic Form of Intelligent and Systemic Life, don't know if that can be translated by that...), it's supposed to be my personal assistant.

I'm looking forward to have it taking care of my bank accounts (paying my bills and my credit card when the date comes), managing my calendar, turning on and off my lights at home and etc...

I'll update this readme later.
